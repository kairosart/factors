          <p class="lead">In this project, you will see how you can use a time-series models to predict trading as Stock Shares, etc.

You would like to model stock prices correctly, so as a stock buyer you can reasonably decide when to buy stocks and when to sell them to make a profit. This is where time series modelling comes in. You need good machine learning models that can look at the history of a sequence of data and correctly predict what the future elements of the sequence are going to be.

Warning: Stock market prices are highly unpredictable and volatile. This means that there are no consistent patterns in the data that allow you to model stock prices over time near-perfectly.<br><br>
Don't take it from me, take it from Princeton University economist Burton Malkiel, who argues in his 1973 book,
 <cite>"A Random Walk Down Wall Street," that if the market is truly efficient and a share price reflects all factors immediately as soon as they're made public, a blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a newspaper stock listing should do as well as any investment professional.</cite>
<br><br>
However, let's not go all the way believing that this is just a stochastic or random process and that there is no hope for machine learning. Let's see if you can at least model the data, so that the predictions you make correlate with the actual behavior of the data. In other words, you don't need the exact stock values of the future, but the stock price movements (that is, if it is going to rise of fall in the near future).
